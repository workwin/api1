<div class="content">
<p>
Rosena Sammi Jewelry is delicately handcrafted and should be handled with care. 
We recommend removing your jewelry before applying perfume, make up and using any household chemicals. 22kt gold vermeil and sterling silver jewelry may be cleaned using a soft cotton cloth.</p>

    <div class="accordion" id="section3">How do I care for gold vermeil jewelry?<span></span></div>
<div class="container">
<div class="content">
<p>
Gold vermeil jewelry can be polished lightly with a soft, dry, clean cloth. Polishing too hard may remove some of the coating, so press lightly. Do not use any liquid cleaners, even jewelry cleaners, on gold vermeil jewelry.
